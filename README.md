# Earthquake-Detection-using-Naive-Bayes.
A machine learning project that predicts whether a seismic event is an earthquake or not based on historical data, using the Naive Bayes classification algorithm. Built with Python and scikit-learn.
This project applies a Naive Bayes Classifier to detect the likelihood of an earthquake based on input features such as:

Magnitude

Depth

Latitude

Longitude

It uses a sample CSV dataset for training and testing. The model is trained to classify whether a given seismic event is likely an earthquake (1) or not (0).

Key Features:

Simple implementation using scikit-learn

Lightweight model: Gaussian Naive Bayes

Easy to run and extend

Clean project structure for learning and experimenting
